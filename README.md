## Welcome to Bilot AI-core

### What is AI-core?

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
We wanted to do our own AI-projects faster and with fewer errors. Also, coding same things over and over again is quite stupid and boring. We also felt that the maintenance and development of multiple AI/ML-environments needs a coherent solution. We also wanted to create a solution which bends into several different business problems (e.g. IoT, Customer analytics). These factors led us to develop a "platform" that we call **AI-core**.

The Bilot **AI-core** is basically a collection of code, which facilitates robust development of Machine Learning solutions. It integrates data handling, preprocessing, error handling and logging, model training and versioning, model application, and deployment. All of this is handled with just a few lines of code.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The benefits of Bilot **AI-core** are the following. It speeds up AI/ML development, as all the code is mostly provided. This directly minimizes coding erros (reusable modules) and useless iterations. It is a solid framework for a multiple different ML-problems (business point-of-view). Coming in the form of open-source code, it offers limitless flexibility to the user--â€“modify as much as you like. As a consequence, while we might hold the best understanding of the framework, there is basically no vendor lock.

### Features
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
**AI-core** provides capabilities for end-to-end development of machine leartning projects.
